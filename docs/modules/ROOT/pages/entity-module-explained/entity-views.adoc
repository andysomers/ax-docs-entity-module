== Entity views

EntityModule has the ability to generate automatic views for entities.
When AdminWebModule is present, automatic CRUD pages for entities will be generated using these views.

A view is an abstraction of web controller that allows you to take advantage of the EntityModule configuration system.
Usually views are a rendering of one or more entities of a particular entity type.

Both `EntityConfiguration` and `EntityAssociation` can have their own views defined.
They do so by implementing the `EntityViewRegistry` interface.
Every view has a unique name within an `EntityViewRegistry`.

=== Default views
By default CRUD views will be created for every `EntityConfiguration` with a `CrudRepository` or an `EntityQueryExecutor` registered.
Likewise CRUD views will be created for every `EntityAssociation` with an `AssociatedEntityQueryExecutor` attribute.

NOTE: Query executor attributes should be registered automatically in most cases.
So you usually don't need to worry about those.
See the <<entity-query-executor,chapter on `EntityQueryExecutor`>> for more information.

The following default views will be created for an entity type:

[cols="1,1,3",options="header"]
|===

|View name
|View type
|Description

|listView
(`EntityView.LIST_VIEW_NAME`)
|list view
|Shows the list of entities.

|createView
(`EntityView.CREATE_VIEW_NAME`)
|form view
|Renders and executes the form for creating a new entity.

|updateView
(`EntityView.UPDATE_VIEW_NAME`)
|form view
|Renders and executes the form for updating an entity.

|deleteView
(`EntityView.DELETE_VIEW_NAME`)
|form view
|Shows the confirmation page and performs the delete if allowed.

|===

The default views all render markup using the `ViewElement` infrastructure and the implementations provided by the BootstrapUiModule.
