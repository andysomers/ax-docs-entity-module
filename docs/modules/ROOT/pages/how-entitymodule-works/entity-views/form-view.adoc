==== create and update view

default settings of a form view:

- user must have update allowable action
- renders values as LIST_VALUE
- shows all readable properties
- adds update/delete buttons for every item if the user as update and delete action respectively
- supports paging and sorting
- allows configuring sortable properties and the default sort
- includes a form at the top that can be used for adding filters
- a create button for the entity if the user has create action allowed
- supports global feedback messages set with the `EntityViewPageHelper`

default settings

default processors

A delete action will be available for all entities where `AllowableAction.DELETE` is present, this is the default unless more explicit permissions are configured.
A delete will always redirect to a confirmation page by default.
Because the possibility to delete an entity often depends on other factors (usually associations), the default `EntityDeleteViewFactory` publishes an event that allows customizing said confirmation page.

By catching the `BuildEntityDeleteViewEvent` your code can:

* suppress the ability to delete (by hiding the delete button)
* add associations to the form
* add custom feedback messages to the form (and optionally remove the associations block)

This should be sufficient for most use cases without having to revert to custom `EntityViewProcessor` implementations.
Of course the latter would work as well.

.Entity associations
The initial `BuildEntityDeleteViewEvent` is configured based on the `EntityAssociation` list of the entity.
If associated items are detected, they influence the form settings depending on the *parentDeleteMode* property of the `EntityAssociation`:

* `ParentDeleteMode.IGNORE`: item information is not printed nor influences the ability to delete
* `ParentDeleteMode.WARN`: item information is printed on the form but does not influence the ability to delete
* `ParentDeleteMode.SUPPRESS`: item information is printed on the form and disables the ability to delete, this is the default setting

The event is published after the initial association information has been set.

.Performing the delete
The EntityModule simply calls the delete method of the `EntityModel`, usually a direct call to a repository `delete()`.
You will have to take care yourself of complex delete scenarios - like deleting the associations - by either modifying the `EntityModel` or using another mechanism like the `EntityInterceptor`.

==== creating an additional form view

[[configuring-form-text]]
==== Configuring form controls text
A form view usually renders properties in either `ViewElementMode.FORM_WRITE` or `ViewElementMode.FORM_READ`, depending on the fact if a property can be edited or not.
By default, a property like this would be rendered as a form group (`FormGroupElement` that is usually a combination of the label and the control for the property) or a <<fieldset-properties,fieldset>> (`FieldsetFormElement`).

In `FORM_READ` (readonly) mode, the default form renders only the label of a property.
You can customize the label value by setting the corresponding message code, for example: `UserModule.entities.user.properties.username=Name of the user`.

In `FORM_WRITE` mode several other message codes will be resolved as well, and if they return values, additional content will be shown on the form.

.Description text
A description provides additional context for the property being shown.
It is rendered above the control of a form group, or above the content of a fieldset.

[source=properties]
----
UserModule.entities.user.properties.username[description]=The username must be unique.
----

.Help text
Help text is rendered below the control of a form group, or below the content of a fieldset.
It usually provides a (less important) hint for updating the value.

[source=properties]
----
UserModule.entities.user.properties.username[help]=Try to pick something you will remember.
----

.Tooltip text
Tooltip text is added as a separate icon (question mark) that will only show the actual tooltip when you hover over it with the mouse cursor.
Tooltips are often used as an alternative for help text.
The difference is that help text is always visible, whereas to see the tooltip a used will need to take an extra action.

The tooltip icon is added to the label of a form group or to the legend of a fieldset.

[source=properties]
----
UserModule.entities.user.properties.username[tooltip]=You will receive an errror when saving if your username is already taken.
----

By default all message codes allow HTML entities, so you can add additional links or markup to them.

NOTE: In case of a form group you can also manually set the different text components from code.
Values set from code will take precedence and will never be replaced by the values resolved from message codes.

A more detailed explanation of how message codes are resolved and which codes are possible can be found in <<message-codes,the appendix>>.
