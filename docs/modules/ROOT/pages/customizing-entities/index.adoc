[[builders]]
=== Using builders
Entities are usually automatically added to the `EntityRegistry` through the use of one or more `EntityRegistrar` beans.
The registrars will apply a default configuration, usually consisting of all properties, associations and views.

Customizing the `EntityRegistry` is done by implementing one or more `EntityConfigurer` beans in your modules.
These receive an `EntitiesConfigurationBuilder` that effectively allows you to customize all registered `EntityConfiguration` instances.
Multiple `EntityConfigurer` beans can modify the same `EntityConfiguration`, the order in which they are applied will determine the last value if they modify the same properties.

Investigate the javadoc of the `EntitiesConfigurationBuilder` and child builders to discover all possible configuration options.

@AcrossDepends(required = "EntityModule")
@Configuration
public class UserEntitiesConfiguration implements EntityConfigurer
{
	@Override
	public void configure( EntitiesConfigurationBuilder configuration ) {
		// By default permissions cannot be managed through the user interface
		configuration.withType( Permission.class ).hide();
	}
}

=== Configuring properties
Properties for an entity can be configured through the builders as well.
New properties can be added or the default properties can modified.
How properties are configured determines how they will be rendered on the generated forms.

hidden:: A hidden property will by default not be returned when requesting all properties from an `EntityPropertyRegistry`.
You can still get this property directly however, the `hidden` state means a property will not advertise itself, you must know of its existence.

readable:: Any readable property can be rendered in all views.
This state means that a form control can always be generated, even though it might very well be readonly if the property is not `writable`.

writable::  A writable property can be rendered in form views.
In case a property is writable but not readable, the property can only be included in forms but not in other views.

WARNING: The `hidden` state has no correlation with a hidden form control.
Setting a property to be rendered as a hidden form control can only be done through configuring the right `ViewElement` information for that property.

==== Configuring a label
An entity with a corresponding `EntityConfiguration` always has a label, this is a textual representation of the entity in for example lists.
This could be the *name* or the * title* property for example.
By default the label corresponds to a custom generated property *#label* that defaults to calling `toString()` on the entity.

You can configure the label using the `label()` method on a `PropertyDescriptorBuilder`.
This is equivalent to calling `property("#label")`.
If you want to use another property as the base for label generation, you can configure this on the `EntityConfigurationBuilder` by calling `label("propertyName")`.
This will copy all settings from the source property to the *#label* property, but keep in mind it still is a separate property that can be customized.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@Override
public void configure( EntitiesConfigurationBuilder entities ) {
    // Configure the username to be used as label for a User entity
    entities.withType( User.class ).label( "username" );

    // Configure the group name to be used as base label, but modify the value fetcher so
    // the label is prefixed with Group
    entities.withType( Group.class )
            .properties( props -> props.label( "name" ).spelValueFetcher( "'Group: ' + name" ) );
}
----

If you do not wish to use the *#label* property at all as default entity label, you can customize the `Printer` used for label generation by modifying the `EntityModel`.

NOTE: As *#label* is a generated property, sorting is not enabled by default.
If you configure the label using an existing property, the sortable attribute will be copied as well and sorting on label will be possible.

=== Customizing entity validation

By default annotation validation is performed on all entities.
Customizing validation can be done by simply specifying a `Validator` bean that supports the specific entity type.
You can use the `EntityValidatorSupport` as a base class to extend the default annotation based entity validation.

If more than one `Validator` could be applied, you will manually have to set the `Validator.class` attribute on the `EntityConfiguration` to the correct one.
